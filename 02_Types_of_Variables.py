var1 = 23  # This is a varibale
var2 = 23.4  # This is also a variable
var3 = 12.90909090909090909  # This is also a variable
var4 = "Hello World"  # This is also a variable

# but to check what type of variable it is we do:
print(type(var1))
print(type(var2))
print(type(var3))
print(type(var4))
print("Hello ji")
print("Hello ji")
