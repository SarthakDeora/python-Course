# Now its time to learn the most important thing which is For Loop

print("Hello my name is Sarthak Deora")  # normal printing
list1 = [["Sarthak", 12], ["Dhruv", 45]]  # I  made 2 lists in a list
# This is how we make a for loop, After that for i made 2 variables as u can see  so i amde 2 lists in 1 list and 2 items in both the lists so for the first one in each list variable "lol" is given and for the second one i have given it "lolly" and after 'in' I have specified that do these things in a list named "list1"
for lol, lolly in list1:
    print(lol, "Eats", lolly, )
print(lol)
