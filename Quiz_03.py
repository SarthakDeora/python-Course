# IN this quiz i have to take an input from the user and the code should ask the user to type a number untill and unlesss the user types a number more than 100.
while True:
    num1 = int(input("Type a number: "))
    if (num1 < 100):
        continue
    else:
        break
# Done LOLLLLLLLLLL It was easy but I didnt made the input an integer so it showed error but when i read the error carefully i managed to find it.
