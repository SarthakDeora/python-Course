# Bitwise Operators


# Arethematic Operators

# Operators which are used in Mathematical equations

# For example
print("****************Arethematic Operators****************")
print("24 + 6 =", 24+6)
print("24 - 6 =", 24-6)
print("24 * 6 =", 24*6)
print("24 / 6 =", 24/6)
# This gives the answer by dividing but does not tell the numbers after the decimal point
print("24 // 6 =", 24//6)
print("24 ** 6 =", 24**6)     # Normal Exponent and powers
print("24 % 6 =", 24 % 6)       # This will give the remainder

# Assignement Operators
print("****************Assignement Operators****************")
# Assignement operators gives something a value Best example is making variales and giving them values

x = 10
print(x)

x -= 5   # ----> x = x - 5
print(x)
x = 10

x += 5  # ----> x = x + 5
print(x)
x = 10

x /= 5  # ----> x = x / 5
print(x)
x = 10

x *= 5  # ----> x = x * 5
print(x)
x = 10

x //= 5  # ----> x = x // 5
print(x)
x = 10

x **= 5  # ----> x = x ** 5
print(x)
x = 10

# Comparison Operators
print("****************Comparison Operators****************")
i = 5

print(i == 5)  # Tells if it is equal
print(i != 5)  # Tells if it is not equal
print(i >= 5)  # Tells if it is equal or greater than
print(i <= 5)  # Tells if it is equal or smaller than
print(i < 5)  # Tells if it is smaller than
print(i > 5)  # Tells if it is greater than


# Logical Operators
print("****************Logical Operators****************")
a = True
b = False
print(a and b)  # true and False will give false just like integers
print(a and a)   # true and true is obvioulsy true
print(a or b)  # or will tell true even if only one of them is true


# Identity Operators
print("****************Identity Operators****************")

print(5 is 5)
print(5 is not 5)

# Membership Operators
print("****************Membership Operators****************")

list1 = [45, 54, 325, 3254, 254, 35, 3253, 25, 342, 543, 54, 32, 5]

print(5 in list1)
print(5 not in list1)

# Bitwise Operators

print("****************Bitwise Operators****************")

print("Its not that interesting and usefull for me sooooooo i dont wanna practice it")
